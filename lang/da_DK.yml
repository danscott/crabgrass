  h1. Riseup Networks' Social Contract
  
  Riseup.net exists because we feel it is vital for communities of resistance to be able to provide for their own communication needs. We must not be forced to rely on insecure, profit driven means of communication which bombard us with mind numbing advertising and expose us to mass surveillance. 
  
  Riseup.net believes in direct democracy, anti-sexism, anti-racism, anti-capitalism, self determination, local autonomy, ecology, and communal economics. For more information, you can view our [purpose -> http://help.riseup.net/purpose] and [political principles -> http://help.riseup.net/political-principles].
  
  Riseup.net affirms common cause and solidarity with a broad spectrum of the political left. However, there are some things which we cannot support. We ask that you do not use riseup.net services to advocate any of the following: 
  
  * Support for capitalism, domination, or hierarchy.
  * The idea that class oppression supersedes race or gender oppression.
  * A vanguard strategy for revolution.
  * Population control in countries other than your own.
  
  If you disagree with this, then riseup.net is not for you.
  
  h1. Riseup Networks' Privacy Policy
  
  h3. We keep minimal logs
  
  Most Online Service Providers keep detailed records of all connections. In general, we do not keep information which uniquely identifies you or could be used to build a profile of your usage and associations. We do not log IP addresses. For troubleshooting, we may enable increased logging for brief periods of time. These extra logs are deleted immediately after they are used.
  
  h3. We do not share data with anyone
  
  We do not share any user information with any other groups or individuals. Within the Riseup Collective, members of the collective have access only to information which they need in order to perform their work.
  
  h3. We will defend your data
  
  We will actively fight any attempt to force Riseup Networks to disclose user information or logs.
  
  h3. We will not monitor your communications
  
  We will not read, search, or process any of your incoming or outgoing mail other than to protect you from viruses and spam or when directed to do so by you when troubleshooting.
  
  h3. Your data is encrypted
  
  The content of your communications, the calendar date of your last login, your addressbook, and all backups are stored in encrypted format.

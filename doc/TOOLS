= Crabgrass Tools

This is documentation specific to Crabgras Tools.

A tool can do pretty much anything. It can be an entire rails
application. However, the typical case is that whenever a Page of the
type defined in the tool is to be shown, then crabgrass will use the
controllers and views defined in that tool. 

How does it know? Because of a call like this placed in the init.rb of
the tool:

  PageClassRegistrar.add(
    'WikiPage',
    :controller => 'wiki_page',
    :model => 'Wiki',
    :icon => 'wiki.png',
    :class_display_name => 'wiki',
    :class_description => 'A free-form text document.',
    :class_group => 'wiki'
  )

In this example, whenever a page of type WikiPage is displayed, the
controller WikiPageController will be called (derived from the
camelcase of :controller). This could live anywhere, but we happen to
have bundled this controller in the tool under:

  tools/wiki_tool/app/controllers/wiki_page_controller.rb

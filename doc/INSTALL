= Install the necessary packages

These packages are required:

Make sure your git-core is a version => 1.5.6.5, there is a newer version available in etch-backports if you are running etch

apt-get install git-core

apt-get install ruby1.8 ruby1.8-dev libmysql-ruby rubygems rake

= Grab The Code

To get a copy of the most recent code:

  cd ~/development
  git clone git://labs.riseup.net/crabgrass.git

See https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/show/crabgrass for information on releases.

= Install optional packages

These packages are optional, but necessary for image thumbnails and document previews.

  apt-get install openoffice.org openoffice.org-headless msttcorefonts

For more information on generating previews, see ASSETS[link:files/doc/ASSETS.html].

= Install Gems

You can use Crabgrass with the debian packages for ruby libraries, but this is difficult and unstable. It is recommended that you install the required gems using rubygems. 

Basic gems to get rails working:

  gem install rake --no-ri --no-rdoc
  gem install -v=2.1.0 rails --no-ri --no-rdoc

These gems are required for Crabgrass:

  gem install tzinfo RedCloth --no-ri --no-rdoc

These gems are optional:

  gem install haml ruby-debug hpricot mime-types chronic packet --no-ri --no-rdoc

See GEMS[link:files/doc/GEMS.html] for a description of what these gems are used for.

= Setup Mysql Database

Crabgrass only works with mysql.

Install mysql and create the databases:

  apt-get install mysql-server
  mysqladmin -u root -p create crabgrass create crabgrass_development create crabgrass_test

There is a sample database configuration file in the <tt>config</tt> directory of the
crabgrass application. Use that to create a <tt>config/database.yml</tt> file:

  cd ~/development/crabgrass/config
  cp database.yml.example database.yml

For development mode, the example database.yml should be good to go, unless you have a set
a password for mysql. 

For some linux distributions, you may need to specify a socket file for mysql like so:
<tt>socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock</tt>. You can probably figure out what socket
to use by running <tt>ps -ef | grep mysql</tt>.

The final step is to load the crabgrass schema and populate it with test data:

  cd ~/development/crabgrass
  rake db:schema:load
  rake db:fixtures:load
  rake cg:load_default_data

To upgrade the crabgrass database after pulling in new code:

  cd ~/development/crabgrass
  git pull
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:fixtures:load
  rake cg:load_default_data

Also, <tt>rake --version</tt> must be 0.8.1 or greater.

= Running Crabgrass

  cd ~/development/crabgrass
  script/server

This will run crabgrass in development mode, which is probably what you want. If
you donâ€™t want to use webbrick (the mini-web-server that comes with rails) you
can install the mongrel gem or debian package. If installed, script/server will
pick them instead.

Once the server is running, just point your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

If you have run <tt>rake db:fixtures:load</tt>, there will be a bunch of test data
loaded, including users. To get started, you can login as user 'blue' with
password 'blue'.

= Troubleshooting

If you get:

  extconf.rb:11:in `require': no such file to load -- mkmf (LoadError)

...then you need also to install ruby1.8-dev.

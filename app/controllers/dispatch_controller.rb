# We have a problem: every page type has a different controller. 
# This means that we either have to declare the controller somehow
# in the route, or use a special dispatch controller that will pass
# on the request to the page's controller.
# 
# We have it set up so that we can do both. A static route would look like:
#   
#   /groups/riseup/wiki/show/40/
# 
# A route using this dispatcher would look like this:
# 
#   /riseup/40
# 
# The second one is prettier, but perhaps it is slower? This remains to be seen.
# 
# the idea was taken from:
# http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/07/09/16917.aspx
# 
# the dispatcher handles urls in the form:
# 
# /:context/:page/:page_action/:id
# 
# :context can be a group name or user login
# :page can be the name or id of the page.
# :page_action is the action that should be passed on to the page's controller
# :id is just there as a catch all id for extra fun in case the
#     page's controller wants it.
#
#
# TODO: I think the dispatchController breaks flash hash. Fix it!
#

= PATH FINDER

A module to find crabgrass pages.

This module handles all the complicated code that makes page queries work.
Currently, it handles SQL and sphinx queries. Eventually, we have plans to
improve the SQL queries using a clever full text search approach.

== How to use PathFinder ?

Look at the examples for now: lib/path_finder/EXAMPLES

There is also a list of the filters: lib/path_finder/FILTERS

== Structure of PathFinder

PathFinder::Builder::       the class that converts between a path and actual
                            database conditions.

PathFinder::ParsedPath::    a subclass of Array used to represent a query filter path
                            that has been parsed.

PathFinder::Options::       a module included in all controllers to help build
                            the options hash needed by the page finders.

PathFinder::FindByPath::    a module that is included by Page to add the 
                            find_by_path and count_by_path methods. 

Additionally, there are three backends:

* PathFinder::Sql for a generic sql database
* PathFinder::Mysql for a mysql database will fulltext index on page_terms
* PathFinder::Sphinx for fulltext searching of page body content.

Each of these backends is defined in x_builder.rb, x_builder_filters.rb, and x_options.rb

Why all this sillyness? 

1. makes it easy to switch back and forth between urls and actual queries
2. makes it so that we can switch storage backends without changing application logic.
3. finding pages is way complicated, and it is nice to have all that
   logic hidden away.
